# BetterSpectator
Small spectation plugin for friends` minecraft bedwars server. Made only for educational use!


"I'm interested in ordering a plugin for Minecraft version 1.8-1.8.9 (Spigot), that offers spectating options for admins. 
Features would include:
- a command to enter this specific spectating mode, in which there is:

- a way to spectate a player in first/third person or free flying, and with the player's inventory shown in your inventory, so you can see what the player is carrying and using. 
- a way to quickly switch between players to spectate in a single world, without using commands.
- a small sidebar that displays while spectating, that shows the spectated player's username and HP;  kill count and death count, that can be refreshed to zero with a command. (a kill should also register when a player hits another player in the void)"
